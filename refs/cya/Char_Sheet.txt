Hi, How are you?
DO NOT answer that!
I am the DM (that means Dungeon Master)
I will be here to guide you and your nerdy best friend's through my world of Cargorth.
To be more specific;
The Kingdom of Aidon, The most advanced Kingdom there is!
I have already gone ahead and made most of your character sheet, now we just need to wait for the other two.
One hour later....
            --Step 1--
It would appear as though they are not going to show up so it will be just you and me
Are you okay with that?

"Yes"
Brilliant, then just enter your character's name below: 
[Step 2]
    --Choice 2--

            --Step 1_1-- ## ADD Fun Loop Claus To "I Cant Stop You From Doing That"
Well you don't really have a choice, unless you want to leave the game of course. I cant stop you from doing that.
Do you want to exit the game? 
    --Choice 1--
"Yes"
Okay, goodbye
[GiveUpBeg()]
    --Choice 2--
"No"
Then enter in your character's name below:
Okay, on with the game then.
