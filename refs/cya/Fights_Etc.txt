Turning left yield's a strong stench of just rotten flesh and decay and the further down that passage you travel the stronger the smell gets, and after a couple of twists and turns you hear chewing.
As you get closer you see a 7ft creature, that appears to have various spikes on its back, its black sickly decaying flesh blending in almost perfectly with the walls of the cave.
If it wasn't for the glowing reflection on the cave floor and the dried blood on its claws.
It hasn't noticed you yet. Maybe you could make a surprise attack on it.

Press Enter to enter the Nothic's lair, and prepare a surprise attack
            --[End FinBoss]--

            --[Start YouLoose()]--
As your foe hits you one final time and you fall to the ground vision blurry, the last thing you see is your own blood pooling around, then darkness.
            --[End YouLoose()]--

            --[Start GiveUp()]--
Embarrassment and shame fill you as you realize, even though no one saw this and you could've clearly turned around and chosen a new path;
you refuse to turn around and just stand there doing nothing, until either the Nothic comes and eats you or you die of thirst or hunger.
            --[End GiveUp()]--

            --[Start GiveUpBeg()]--
What a shame you are giving up so early. Oh well, better now than waste everyone's time.

        --(Start Fight Lines)--
    --Mimic--
As you approach the chest and open it, the chest opens revealing hundreds of sharp teeth and a tongue and it bites your arm latching onto you, your left arm is now trapped in it's mouth

As you plunge your sword into the mimic it falls limp to the ground lifeless, releasing your arm
    --Skeleton death--
With this strike the skeleton falls down to the ground in a pile of bones, whatever necromantic magic leaving it's bones
    --Beholder death--
You strike the beholder in it's main eye and it lets out a loud screem of pain before it dies, falling to the ground

As you strike the orc one final time, it falls to the ground and expires
